## üîç Overview

This project provides a detailed comparative analysis of different tools used for detecting and classifying Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) in bacterial genomes. The analysis focuses on three important Streptomyces species and evaluates the performance of leading BGC detection tools: antiSMASH, GECCO, and DeepBGC.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Comprehensive comparison of three major BGC detection tools
- Analysis of genomic data from three Streptomyces species
- Visual representation of tool overlaps using Venn diagrams
- Dynamic genomic coordinate plots
- Detailed statistical analysis of tool performance
- Jupyter notebook implementation for reproducible research
