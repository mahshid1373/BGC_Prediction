## üîç Overview

This project provides a detailed comparative analysis of different tools used for detecting and classifying Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) in bacterial genomes. The analysis focuses on three important Streptomyces species and evaluates the performance of leading BGC detection tools: antiSMASH, GECCO, and DeepBGC.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Comprehensive comparison of three major BGC detection tools
- Analysis of genomic data from three Streptomyces species
- Visual representation of tool overlaps using Venn diagrams
- Detailed statistical analysis of tool performance
- Jupyter notebook implementation for reproducible research

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BGC_Prediction.git
cd BGC_Prediction
```

2. Install the BGC detection tools:
```bash
# antiSMASH
conda create -n antismash python=3.8
conda activate antismash
pip install antismash

# GECCO
pip install gecco-tool

# DeepBGC
pip install deepbgc
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Analyzed

### antiSMASH
- Industry standard for BGC detection
- Provides detailed annotations and classifications
- Comprehensive analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways

**Running antiSMASH:**
The analysis was performed using the antiSMASH 6.0 web server:
1. Visit [https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org](https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org)
2. Upload genome files in GenBank/FASTA format
3. Use default settings for bacterial genome analysis
4. Download the GenBank result files

### GECCO
- Rule-based approach for gene cluster detection
- Focuses on genomic context and gene organization
- Efficient processing of large genomic datasets

**Running GECCO:**
```bash
# For each genome file (in FASTA format):
gecco run \
    --genome input_genome.fasta \
    --output gecco_output \
    --proteins proteins.faa \  # Optional: provide protein sequences
    --threads 4 \
    --force    # Overwrite existing output directory
```

GECCO generates three output files in the specified output directory:
- `clusters.tsv`: Contains the predicted BGC locations and types (used for our analysis)
- `features.tsv`: Detailed information about genomic features
- `proteins.faa`: Protein sequences in FASTA format

### DeepBGC
- Machine learning-based BGC classification
- Utilizes deep learning models for prediction
- Capable of detecting novel BGC types

**Running DeepBGC:**
```bash
# Download the pre-trained model (if not already present)
deepbgc download

# Detect BGCs in genome sequences
deepbgc pipeline \
    --input input_genome.fasta \
    --output deepbgc_output \
    --label genome_name \
    --detector hybrid \
    --classifier product-class

# Convert DeepBGC output to GBK format
python scripts/deepbgc_to_gbk.py \
    --input deepbgc_output/bgc.tsv \
    --output output_gbk/genome_deepbgc.gbk
```

### Important Notes
- All tools were run with their default parameters to ensure fair comparison
- Input genomes were provided in FASTA format for GECCO and DeepBGC
- antiSMASH results were downloaded in GenBank format
- Custom scripts were used to convert GECCO and DeepBGC outputs to GenBank format for consistency
- All analyses were performed on complete genome sequences

## üìä Results

### Data Format
The analysis results are stored in two main formats:

#### 1. TSV Summary Files
Located in the `BGC_predictions` folder, these files contain the comparative analysis results:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sequence ID | Identifier for the genomic sequence |
| Start | Start position of the predicted BGC |
| End | End position of the predicted BGC |
| BGC Type | Predicted type of the biosynthetic gene cluster |
| antiSMASH | Binary indicator (1/0) for antiSMASH detection |
| GECCO | Binary indicator (1/0) for GECCO detection |
| DeepBGC | Binary indicator (1/0) for DeepBGC detection |

#### 2. GenBank Files
Located in the `output_gbk` folder, these files contain detailed genomic annotations:

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| S.coelicolor_A3_modified.gbk | Annotated genome of S. coelicolor | 19MB |
| Streptomyces_ameniacus_modified.gbk | Annotated genome of S. ameniacus | 20MB |
| Streptomyces_avidinii_modified.gbk | Annotated genome of S. avidinii | 17MB |

The GenBank files contain:
- Complete genome sequences
- Gene annotations
- Predicted BGC locations and types
- Detailed feature annotations from each tool
- Protein and coding sequences
- Tool-specific metadata and predictions

These files can be viewed with genome browsers or bioinformatics tools like Artemis, UGENE, or SnapGene.

### Region Intersection Logic
BGC regions are considered to intersect when they:
1. Share the same sequence ID
2. Have overlapping genomic coordinates

The intersection is determined by the following Python function:
```python
def regions_intersect(region1, region2):
    sequence_id1, start1, end1 = region1
    sequence_id2, start2, end2 = region2
    return (str(sequence_id1) == str(sequence_id2)) and (max(start1, start2) <= min(end1, end2))
```

This means two regions intersect if:
- They are on the same sequence (sequence_id1 == sequence_id2)
- The start of one region is before the end of the other region (max(start1, start2) <= min(end1, end2))

### Comparative Analysis

#### Streptomyces coelicolor

- 20 BGCs detected by all three tools (17%)
- 81 unique regions identified by DeepBGC (68%)
- 5 unique regions detected by antiSMASH (4%)
- 2 unique regions found by GECCO (2%)
- Most common BGC types: Polyketide, NRP, Terpene

Key findings:
- Total BGCs detected: 106
- 23 BGCs detected by all three tools (21%)
- 67 unique regions identified by DeepBGC (62%)
- 8 unique regions detected by GECCO (7%)
- 1 unique region found by antiSMASH (1%)
- Most common BGC types: Polyketide, NRP, Terpene

### Key Observations
1. **Tool Agreement**: Approximately 15-20% of BGCs are detected by all three tools across species
2. **DeepBGC Sensitivity**: DeepBGC consistently identifies the most unique regions (60-70%)
3. **BGC Types**: 
   - Polyketide clusters are the most frequently detected
   - NRP (Non-Ribosomal Peptide) clusters are common across all species
   - Terpene clusters show high conservation
4. **Unknown Regions**: DeepBGC identifies many regions as "Unknown" type, suggesting potential novel BGCs
